# This is to be the only service that can access Table Data,
# this could be a good service to start with and work backwards.
# This is the only service with access to the SQL and must share
# data in JSON format only. content must be consistant throughout
# and comments next to the functions explaining the details that
# must be recived inorder for function to perform correctly.

# REMEMBER TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT
# List expected outcomes of each function before writing the function itself.
# This should make Pytests quicker to complete and will test the full performance of the code developed.
